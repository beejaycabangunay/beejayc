<p style="text-align:center;color:Black"> "Shy"</p>

<pre style="text-align:center;">
Every time you walk into the room
Got me feeling crazy, shock my heart boom boom
Any other boy would stare but me
I look away 'cause you're making me scared

Trying not to breathe 1, 2, 3
Trying not to freak when you look at me
Gotta make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy

Rejection is a word that I don't wanna know
But a girl like you could kill a boy real slow
A million words stuck up in my head
Waiting to be said but my tongue is stumbling

Trying not to breathe 1, 2, 3
Trying not to freak when you look at me
Trying to make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you take me high

I feel like I can fly
But I fall out of the sky
When I look into your eyes

Oh, girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy

Girl, you make me shy
Can't even talk to you
Girl, you make me shy</pre>
